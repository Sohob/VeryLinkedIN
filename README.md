# VeryLinkedIN - a LinkedIN Replica


## Description:

VeryLinkedIN is a replica of the infamous LinkedIN website. Our application is designed to withstand and fully function under heavy loads. Our scalable application was built using Java Spring Boot with a microservices architecture and follows command design pattern. Each service is decoupled so that our microservices run independently. The services run dynamically using the concept of reflection.
